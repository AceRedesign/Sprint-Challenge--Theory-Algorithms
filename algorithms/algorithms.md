# Exercise 1:

a) This is O(n) since it will only run a limited number of times.

b) This would be O(log n) since it is dividing n by a number greater than 1.

c) The outer is log n, the inner first is n, the second inner is n.

d) O(n log n) as the outer loop runs log n times.

e) O(n^4) because there is 3 nested loops.

f) this is 0(n)

g) 0(n) because it runs once for every arraysize value from 0 to 1.

# Exercise 2:

a) I honestly don't think you can have a linear solution for this particular problem. Unless its in nested for loops.

b) Start on floor 1 and drop an egg. If it breaks, return f = -1 as it's not possible to drop an egg without breaking it.

    Go to floor n and drop an egg. If it doesn't break, return f = n as the top floor is low enough not to break the egg.

Not entirely sure.

# Exercise 3:

a) This is O(n) as the number of steps is equal to the number of elements.

b) It is 0(n) because its a recursive solution.
